## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze CRM sales opportunities to identify trends, top performers, and growth areas across product lines, geographies, and sales teams. The analysis was guided by several key questions:
- Which sales are performing in terms of revenue and deals made?
- What is the average deal closing time for both sales teams and individual agents?
- How do sales performances vary by country?
- Which agents are lagging, and what is their contribution to team revenues and sales volumes?
- Do discounts offered contribute to higher sales revenues?
- What are the monthly and quarterly volume and revenue trends?
- Which products are doing well in terms of revenues and time to close?
- What is the sector-wise revenue contribution?

## Data
The data was sourced from Mavenâ€™s Data Playground and consisted of four tables:
- **Accounts**
- **Products**
- **Sales Teams**
- **Sales Pipeline**

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process was performed using **Excel**, and **Tableau** was used for visualizing the data:
- **Excel**: 
  - Data joined using the V-lookup function.
  - Null values removed.
  - Data standardized and formatted correctly for numeric and date fields.
  
- **Tableau**: 
  - Used for visualization and trend identification.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Improve Performance and Retention
- **Sales Training Programs**: 
  - Introduce targeted training for underperforming sales agents to improve deal closing times and volumes.
  - Use top agents like Melvin Marxen as mentors for the team.

- **Regional Focus**: 
  - Increase efforts in regions like Germany and Jordan by launching targeted regional campaigns and leveraging the success of the U.S. market globally.

### 2. Optimize Strategies (Discounts & Marketing)
- **Discount Optimization**: 
  - Reassess discount strategies for products like **GTK 500** and **GTX Basic** where discounts may not lead to proportional sales increases.
  - Maintain profitability for **GTX-Pro** through dynamic discounting.

- **Marketing Strategy**: 
  - Focus on high-performing sectors like retail and medical, while boosting visibility in lagging sectors like entertainment.

### 3. Enhance Operations
- **Cash Flow Management**: 
  - Address revenue volatility by adjusting billing cycles, diversifying products, and reducing seasonal demand fluctuations.
  - Aggressively push sales and marketing efforts during slower months (e.g., July, October).

- **Operational Efficiency**: 
  - Streamline product delivery, especially for high-discount items like **GTK 500**, to improve cost-effectiveness.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights for refining product pricing, discount strategies, and sales training. By focusing on top-performing products like **GTX-Pro** and underperforming regions, the company can enhance profitability and operational efficiency, ensuring year-round success.
